							Summary
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						I am Hassan Mahdian Manesh, a Backend Developer specializing in the Laravel framework. Since
						high school, I have been interested in Physics and Computer Science. I completed my Bachelor's
						degree in Physics at Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, followed by a Master's degree in
						Physics (Atomic and Molecular Physics) at Amirkabir University of Technology.
					</p>
					<p>
						During my Master's studies, I became familiar with the Linux operating system and various
						programming languages such as C/C++, Python, MATLAB, and PHP. My Master's thesis involved the
						computer simulation of a plasma environment. For the main computations, I used C to maximize
						performance, and for the post-processing phase, I utilized the R language. To reduce execution
						time, this project employed parallel processing (using the OpenMP library) and various
						optimization techniques in C.
					</p>
					<p>
						After completing my Master's degree, my focus shifted towards web application development,
						leading me to the Laravel framework. Since 2019 (1398 SH), I have been developing backend
						systems based on Laravel and am continuously enhancing my skills in this field. I am passionate
						about Linux and Free/Open Source Software (FOSS), and I am enthusiastic about gaining new
						experiences, collaborating in teams, and tackling technical challenges.

								OpenStack is a free and open-source cloud computing platform, typically deployed as

								component is OpenStack Swift, a distributed, highly available object storage service
								based on a microservice architecture. To enhance Swift's security, a custom Middleware
								was developed in Python. This Middleware intercepts uploaded files destined for storage
								and sends them to a Function-as-a-Service (FAAS) for security scanning by
								Multi-Antivirus (MultiAV) systems. If a file is flagged as malicious or problematic by
								the MultiAV system, it is moved to a quarantine area. Key system features:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Kubernetes-based deployment.

								</li>
								<li>
									Very high availability.

								For approximately 6 months, while collaborating part-time with Novin52, I worked
								full-time at Mandegar Darman Iranian Co. as a member of the backend team (3 backend devs
								in a 6-person tech team) on the <b>Sahda</b> project.

								services domain, designed and developed to establish direct connections between patients
								and healthcare providers (including doctors, hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, traditional
								medicine centers, etc.). By facilitating patient access to diverse medical services and
								utilizing fixed pricing approved by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, this
								platform aims to improve the quality of access to healthcare services for the community.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Examples of key features where I contributed to the backend
									implementation:</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Development and maintenance of four distinct user panels: Patients, Medical Centers,
									Organizations, and System Administration.
								</li>
								<li>
									Backend implementation of the chat system between patients and medical centers,
									including features like file and location sharing, user reporting/blocking, and
									automatic chat closure.
								</li>

									payment processing, invoicing, electronic wallet (e-wallet), and management of
									various transaction types.
								</li>
								<li>
									Backend implementation of the step-by-step management system for the appointment
									booking and visit process.
								</li>
